this word list comprises the intersection of 5 letter words occurring in three source lists: 
  - wikipedia's list of most 100k most common words in the english language
  - the american english dictionary file on my laptop
  - the british english dictionary file on my laptop
  
the source lists are sanitised by dropping words that contain non-alphabetic or non-ascii
characters and converting capitals to lowercase.

only words that occur in all three resulting lists are kept.
